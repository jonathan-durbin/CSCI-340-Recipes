## Intro
This is my egg sandwich recipe! I hope you enjoy. This recipe is carefully tuned to working on an electric stovetop - if you're cooking on gas, you may need to change some of the timing.

## Ingredients

1. 2 Eggs
1. 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese
1. 2 slices of bread
1. 1 tbsp of butter
1. Salt
1. Pepper
1. Hot sauce (texas sauce)

## Directions

1. Place butter in skillet over medium heat, let it get to the point where it just starts to darken and smell like almonds.
1. Break two eggs in the skillet, stir briefly to break up the yolk.
1. Once the eggs have hardened up enough, flip them and reduce heat to low.
1. About now is where you start to toast your bread.
1. Cover eggs with shredded cheese, to preference.
1. Apply salt and pepper to eggs/cheese.
1. Once the cheese softens and you're able to flip the eggs without losing the cheese, flip them.
1. Let the cheese crisp up under the eggs, increase heat if you're feeling impatient.
1. Once done, flip the eggs back over and get your toast ready.
1. Finally, make the sandwich and enjoy!
